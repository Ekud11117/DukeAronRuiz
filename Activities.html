    </h2>
    <p>
        As a passionate learner in Computer Programming I, I have actively participated in a variety of activities designed to deepen my understanding and proficiency in programming. These activities have played a crucial role in shaping my practical skills and expanding my knowledge base. Below, you'll find a glimpse into some of the engaging activities I've been involved in during the 1st Semester 2nd Quarter.
